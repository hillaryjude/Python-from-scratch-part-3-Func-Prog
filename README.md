## Summary
This document provides an overview of key concepts in functional programming, including different methods of parameter passing and essential built-in functions. It serves as a guide for understanding the foundational elements and practical applications of functional programming.

## Table of Contents

### 1. Functional Programming
- **Call by Value**: Explains the method of passing arguments to functions where the actual value is passed.
- **Call by Reference**: Describes the method of passing arguments to functions where a reference to the actual data is passed.
- **Functional Programming**: Provides an introduction to the paradigm of functional programming, emphasizing the use of functions and immutability.

### 2. Inbuilt Functions in Functional Programming
- **Map**: Details the `map()` function, which applies a given function to all items in an input list.
- **Filter**: Explains the `filter()` function, which constructs a list from those elements of the input list for which a function returns true.
- **Reduce**: Describes the `reduce()` function, which applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list.

### 3. Miscellaneous Concepts
- Covers additional concepts and topics that are relevant to functional programming but do not fall under the previous categories.
